    text: "I absolutely think Haaris is worth a premium price point. If you're tired of adjuncting and seriously trying to land a full-time job, paying for his expertise makes sense—he streamlines the process and tells you which schools are realistic, which are a reach, and how you line up against institutional expectations. On an adjunct salary, I'd still pay it, because the value of shaving years off trial-and-error in this market is huge.",

    text: "Like many academics, I know that what seems perfectly clear in my own head doesn't always come across clearly on the page. I'm incredibly grateful to have had someone who has actually served on hiring committees—who really knows what he's talking about—look at my materials and show me what could be very easily improved in how I present myself. What Haaris really gave me is a set of very concrete questions to pose to myself about my application documents. I now have specific, actionable to-do lists to refine them so they make a much stronger argument on my behalf. Confidence isn't something I have in spades, but after our session I feel much clearer and more comfortable.",

    text: "Coming into this, I honestly didn't understand how to approach academic roles. I didn't know how faculty hiring committees read my materials or how to tell my story in a way that made sense to them. Working with Haaris, I finally got a clear view of the actual process: how committees use rubrics, what they score, and how my documents are really being evaluated. He showed me how to turn my executive and industry background into an academic narrative that speaks directly to those criteria. I left with specific, actionable steps to improve my CV, cover letter, and teaching statement, plus a concrete networking strategy tailored to my target universities.",
