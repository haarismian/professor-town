              <li>
                <strong>Diverse institutional types:</strong> Research universities (R1, R2), liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and specialized institutions each have different expectations and cultures.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Regional variations:</strong> Academic culture, salary ranges, and cost of living vary significantly by region.

              <li>
                <strong>Emphasis on fit:</strong> U.S. searches prioritize alignment with department needs, teaching philosophy, and institutional mission.

            <p>
              Understanding visa options and sponsorship requirements is crucial. Start early and be prepared to discuss these matters during interviews.

            <p><strong>Common visa categories for academics:</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0">
              <li>
                <strong>H-1B:</strong> Most common for tenure-track positions. Requires employer sponsorship and can lead to permanent residency.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>J-1:</strong> Often used for visiting scholars and some faculty positions. May have home residency requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>O-1:</strong> For individuals with extraordinary ability. Requires extensive documentation but offers more flexibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>EB-1/EB-2:</strong> Employment-based green cards for permanent positions. Can be sponsored by institutions.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>During the application process:</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0">
              <li>
                Research which institutions regularly sponsor visas and understand their processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be prepared to discuss visa status in interviews, but don't lead with it unless asked.
              </li>
              <li>
                Understand that visa sponsorship involves costs and time for institutions; frame your value proposition accordingly.

            <p>
              U.S. academic culture has specific norms around communication, self-presentation, and professional relationships that may differ from your home country.

                <li>
                  <strong>Self-promotion:</strong> U.S. academics expect candidates to confidently articulate their accomplishments. Practice talking about your work without excessive modesty.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Direct communication:</strong> Be clear and direct in interviews and written materials. Avoid overly indirect or ambiguous language.

                <li>
                  <strong>Teaching philosophy:</strong> U.S. institutions value active learning, student engagement, and inclusive pedagogy. Familiarize yourself with these concepts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Service expectations:</strong> Understand that U.S. faculty often have significant service responsibilities beyond teaching and research.

              </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
              <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem">
                Will being international hurt my chances?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Many U.S. institutions actively value international perspectives and diversity. While visa sponsorship adds complexity, strong candidates with clear value propositions are competitive. Focus on demonstrating fit and addressing potential concerns proactively.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
              <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem">
                Should I mention visa status in my application?
              </h3>
              <p>
                If you already have work authorization, mention it. If you'll need sponsorship, you can address it briefly but focus on your qualifications. Some applications ask directly about visa status; answer honestly and positively.
              </p>

                How do I explain gaps or differences in my background?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Be transparent and contextual. Explain how your path makes sense in your home country's system, then connect it to U.S. expectations. Frame differences as assets that bring unique perspectives.
              </p>

              <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem">
                What if I don't have U.S. teaching experience?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Many successful international candidates don't have U.S. teaching experience. Highlight your teaching experience, explain how it translates to U.S. contexts, and demonstrate understanding of U.S. pedagogical approaches. Consider taking online courses or workshops on U.S. teaching methods.
