              I have observed that learning how to write a good research

            <h2>The Core Function: Trajectory Over Archive</h2>
            <p>
              A common misconception among early-career academics is that the
              research statement is an archive of what they have already done.
            </p>
            <p>In my experience, this approach is fatal.</p>
            <p>
              When I sit on a committee, I do not read a statement to learn what
              you did for your dissertation; I read it to determine if you are
              tenurable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The university makes a significant financial investment in a new
              faculty member.
            </p>
            <p>
              They need assurance that this investment will yield returns in the
              form of grants, publications, and prestige five years from now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the most effective statements I see function as a
              trajectory.
            </p>
            <p>
              They use the past only as evidence that the candidate can deliver
              on the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              My rule of thumb is simple: the past supports the future, but it
              does not dominate it.

            <h2>Common Mistakes I See in Rejected Applications</h2>
            <p>
              I consistently observe three specific errors that cause candidates
              to lose points during the review process.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
              1. The Dissertation Dump
            </h3>
            <p>
              Many candidates devote three pages to the minutiae of their
              dissertation and one paragraph to their future work.
            </p>
            <p>
              This signals to the committee that the candidate is looking
              backward rather than forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              I prefer to see a balanced structure; perhaps 30% on the
              dissertation context and 70% on the evolution of that work into
              new projects.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
              2. The Jargon Fortress
            </h3>
            <p>I often review files for departments adjacent to my own.</p>
            <p>
              If a candidate uses niche terminology without context, they
              isolate the members of the committee who are not specialists in
              that exact sub-field.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found that the strongest applicants defined their terms early;
              they invited the generalist reader into the conversation rather
              than locking them out.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
              3. The "Next Step" Ambiguity
            </h3>
            <p>
              Vague assertions about "continuing research" are insufficient.
            </p>
            <p>I look for specific, concrete details about the next project.</p>
            <p>
              This includes potential funding sources, specific journals for
              publication, and the precise questions the research will answer.

            <h2>My Framework for Structuring the Narrative</h2>
            <p>
              When I advise candidates on structuring this document, I rely on a
              three-part framework that mirrors the tenure timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
              This structure provides the committee with exactly the information
              they need to visualize the candidate as a colleague.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
              Part 1: The "So What"
            </h3>
            <p>
              I begin with a broad, accessible paragraph that anchors the
              research in a significant problem.
            </p>
            <p>This section answers the question: "Why does this matter?"</p>
            <p>
              I have found that starting with the impact rather than the
              methodology hooks the reader immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              It demonstrates that the candidate understands the broader
              implications of their work.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
              Part 2: The Evidence
            </h3>
            <p>This section covers the dissertation or postdoctoral work.</p>
            <p>
              However, I frame it specifically as the foundation for the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              I focus on the skills acquired, the methodologies mastered, and
              the publications cemented during this phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              This serves as the "proof of concept" that the candidate is
              capable of executing complex projects.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
              Part 3: The 5-Year Plan (The Vision)
            </h3>
            <p>This is the most critical section.</p>
            <p>
              I outline exactly what I plan to achieve in the years leading up
              to the tenure review.
            </p>
            <p>I break this down into two distinct future projects:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0">
              <li>
                <strong>Project A:</strong> The immediate next step (the second
                book or the next grant series).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Project B:</strong> The long-term, high-risk/high-reward
                inquiry.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Including specific names of grant agencies (e.g., NSF, NIH, NEH)
              is highly effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              It shows the committee that I have already thought about how to
              fund the work.

            <h2>Tailoring for the Institution</h2>
            <p>
              One strategy that consistently yields positive results is
              adjusting the statement based on the institution's Carnegie
              Classification.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I apply to R1 institutions, I emphasize external funding and
              high-impact publications.
            </p>
            <p>
              The narrative focuses on how my lab or research group will become
              a leader in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conversely, when I target teaching-focused institutions (PUIs), I
              shift the narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
              I explain how undergraduates will be involved in the research
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              I demonstrate that my research is feasible with a heavy teaching
              load and limited resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ignoring the context of the hiring institution is a quick way to
              be placed in the "no" pile.

            <h2>Final Thoughts on Execution</h2>
            <p>
              The research statement is an exercise in professional projection.
            </p>
            <p>
              It requires the candidate to step out of the role of a student and
              into the role of a peer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have found that the most successful candidates write with
              authority; they state what they will do, not what they hope to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your current draft feels like a summary of your graduate school
              years, it likely needs a revision.
            </p>
            <p>Focus on the horizon.</p>
