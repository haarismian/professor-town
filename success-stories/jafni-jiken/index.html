              <h2>Meet Jafni</h2>
              <p>
                Jafni isn't your typical PhD candidate. He is a global operator—a Malaysian national with a Master's from Iowa and a PhD nearing completion in the UK. He bridges the gap between the boardroom and the lecture hall, bringing massive industry experience in Digital Agriculture and AI into his teaching.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                He doesn't just teach theory; he brings the real world to his students. He utilizes LEGO Serious Play and simulation-based exercises, and he even leveraged his professional network to build live case studies with IKEA.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                Despite a track record that includes securing significant funding and managing complex projects, Jafni felt stuck between two worlds: too "corporate" for traditional academia, but trying to break into a university system that seemed to speak a different language.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section reveal">
              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <div class="case-study-quote">
                <p>
                  "I have 26 applications and a 6-page cover letter. I'm shooting in the dark."
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Jafni was suffering from "The Kitchen Sink Syndrome." Because he had so much valuable experience—from consulting with CEOs to curriculum development—he was trying to force all of it into his application documents.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                <strong>The Clutter Crisis:</strong> His cover letter was a staggering six pages long. His CV was burying his best assets (like his funding history) under pages of less relevant data.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                <strong>The Identity Crisis:</strong> He was conflicted on how to present himself. Was he a researcher? A teacher? An industry expert? By trying to be everything to everyone, he risked being nothing to the hiring committee.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                <strong>The "PhD Limbo":</strong> Competing against candidates with finished PhDs, he felt his "near-completion" status was a handicap he couldn't overcome.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                He came to Professor Town with a burning question: <strong>"How do I stop just applying and start competing?"</strong>
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section reveal">
              <h2>How Professor Town Helped</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>We stopped "guessing" and started Auditing.</strong>
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                We took Jafni's sprawling experience and compressed it into a lethal, targeted weapon using the "Rubric Reverse-Engineering" method.
              </p>

              <h3>1. The "Golden Sections" Restructure</h3>
              <p>
                Jafni didn't realize that his "Industry Experience" was actually his hidden ace—if positioned correctly.
              </p>
              <div class="case-study-insight">
                <strong>The Insight:</strong> We identified that his ability to secure funding (over $300k equivalent) and his "Pedagogical Innovation" (LEGO/Simulation) were his Golden Sections.
              </div>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                <strong>The Fix:</strong> We reorganized his CV hierarchy based on the specific job posting. If the role was Teaching, his industry case studies went to the top. If it was Research, his funding history took the lead. We cut the fluff and highlighted the wins.
              </p>

              <h3>2. The Cover Letter "Diet"</h3>
              <p>
                We tackled the 6-page cover letter.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                <strong>The Strategy:</strong> We slashed it by 66%, bringing it down to a tight, punchy 2-page narrative. We replaced generic summaries with hard evidence: specific course evaluation scores (4.7/5) and direct quotes from student feedback. We proved his impact rather than just listing his duties.
              </p>

              <h3>3. The "Networking Superpower"</h3>
              <p>
                Jafni was used to cold-calling CEOs, but he was passive with Professors.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                <strong>The Pivot:</strong> We unlocked his "Superpower." We applied his fearless industry networking tactics to the academic job market. Instead of waiting for job postings, Jafni began treating Department Heads like potential business partners—using his "Connector" energy to uncover unlisted sessional roles.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section reveal">
              <h2>The Results</h2>

              <h3>In His Own Words</h3>
              <p>
                "I came in unsure about how to organise my academic CV... whether I should put industry experience first or knowledge exchange. By the end of the session, everything finally clicked."
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                "He noticed details I had never seen myself. Small things like formatting, consistency, and what actually belongs in a faculty CV. I honestly thought my documents were already quite polished, but he found so many areas that could be improved."
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                "There was a moment when he pointed out that the things I thought were unnecessary were actually important, and the things I thought were important were not helping me at all. That really stayed with me."
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                "Would I recommend this service? Yes. One hundred percent yes. If you are applying for faculty roles or if you want to understand how committees think and make decisions, just book the session. It is absolutely worth it."
