              <h2>Meet Christopher</h2>
              <p>
                Christopher Bosley spent over a decade building an impressive
                career in tech, rising to executive roles at companies like Epic
                Games where he worked on Rocket League—developing matchmaking
                systems, building anti-cheat frameworks, and pioneering methods
                to quantify player performance. He directed AI and data
                organizations, managed multi-million dollar initiatives, and
                mentored countless professionals along the way.
              </p>
              <p>But something was missing.</p>
              <p>
                After completing his Master of Legal Studies at the University
                of Utah, Christopher realized he'd never fallen out of love with
                learning—and he wanted to be on the other side of the classroom.
                His dream? Teaching game analytics at his alma mater's newly
                launched Division of Games, helping the next generation of
                professionals bridge the gap between industry and academia.
              </p>
              <p>
                The credentials were there. The passion was undeniable. But the
                path forward was anything but clear.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section reveal">
              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <p>
                Christopher approached academic job applications the same way
                he'd approached everything in his career: dive in and figure it
                out. He applied to three institutions through online portals and
                heard almost nothing back. At Utah Valley University, he made it
                through initial screening rounds but never landed an interview.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem wasn't his qualifications—it was how he was
                presenting them.
              </p>
              <p>
                His resume read like what it was: a polished executive CV
                designed to pass ATS filters and impress corporate recruiters.
                His cover letter led with strategic capabilities and
                organizational achievements. His teaching statement was, in his
                own words, "absolute gibberish"—full of philosophy but lacking
                the concrete evidence hiring committees actually evaluate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Christopher had taught statistics as an adjunct a decade
                earlier. He'd published research. He'd built an entire Python
                curriculum for his analytics team at Epic Games. He'd mentored
                interns who went on to run departments. But none of this showed
                up where it mattered—above the fold, in the language academics
                actually speak.
              </p>
              <p>
                As he put it:
                <em
                  >"I have the right content and not the right language. I'm not
                  speaking to people in the language they need to hear."</em
                >
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section reveal">
              <h2>How Professor Town Helped</h2>
              <p>
                In a single strategy session, we pulled back the curtain on how
                faculty hiring actually works.
              </p>
              <p>
                Christopher got to see real screening rubrics from universities
                like Berkeley, Maryland, and Delaware—the actual scoring
                criteria committees use to evaluate candidates. The revelation
                was immediate: academic hiring committees don't care about
                "enterprise systems architecture" or "delivery frameworks."
                They're looking for evidence of scholarly impact, teaching and
                mentoring potential, and the ability to attract funding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Christopher had all of this. He just needed to surface it
                differently.
              </p>
              <p>We restructured his approach from the ground up:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Resume transformation:</strong> We moved publications
                  and patents above the fold. Reframed his intern mentorship
                  program as evidence of teaching potential. Translated "secured
                  $15 million in program funding" into language that signals
                  grant-writing capability. Cut the executive summary that
                  everyone skips anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cover letter reframe:</strong> Instead of leading with
                  credentials, we flipped the narrative. The new opening: "I'm
                  excited to bring my 15 years of executive experience in the
                  gaming industry to the School of Gaming." Student impact
                  first, qualifications second.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Teaching statement overhaul:</strong> We shifted from
                  philosophy to evidence. That Python curriculum he built at
                  Epic? That's pedagogical development. The interns who became
                  data scientists? That's measurable student outcomes. The
                  training pipeline he created? That's outcome-based instruction
                  in action.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Networking strategy:</strong> We identified that
                  adjunct positions rarely go through formal channels—they
                  happen through relationships. Christopher needed to connect
                  with faculty directly, offer to guest lecture, and position
                  himself as the solution to a program that was clearly
                  understaffed.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section reveal">
              <h2>The Results</h2>
              <p>
                Within weeks of implementing these changes, Christopher's
                trajectory transformed completely.
              </p>
              <ul class="case-study-results-list">
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Landed an adjunct mathematics position at Salt Lake
                    Community College.</strong
                  >
                  His teaching demo and interview went smoothly—he successfully
                  reframed his industry mentorship experience using academic
                  language, exactly as we'd practiced.

                "I really felt like Professor Town was an authoritative research
                resource. There was obvious evidentiary materials, experience in
                the field, and an understanding of how the university hiring
                process works."

                Christopher's journey proves what's possible when you stop
                thinking like an executive and start speaking the language of
                academia. The credentials were always there. He just needed
                someone who sits on hiring committees to show him how we
                actually read applications.
